Web Development Assessment

This project demonstrates the translation of JSON Data using AJAX, in a stylish functional design.

In order to get the site up and running, you need to download the three files of the project and put them into a folder together. Once this is done go into a browser, preferably Google Chrome and go File > Open File > Select "index.html" from the folder you made.
